# 連縁无現里 ~ Misremembered Memories

Created by Mugenri, characters and setting owned by Trick Nostalgie.

I started this project in February of 2021. This is the product of nearly two full years of independent development. I had to teach myself how to draw for this (ugh). I arranged all of the music myself, and I am the sole programmer. However, it wouldn't have been possible without the help of the ph3sx community giving me guidance along the way. 

To give back to all of you, I have decided to open source.

You're free to mod the game in any way you want as long as you aren't selling any of my assets. I encourage anyone new to dnh to use this project as a way to learn, just as I did by tearing through Book of Star Mythology when I started with dnh (though this project is much more applicable for modern dnh as it uses ph3sx). I'd love to see people play around with this as a base and use it to make their own projects, or just take bits and pieces to see how I do things.

Thank you all for sticking with me these two years and watching me make this game. I don't know if I'll ever make another (I would like to find a programming job soon and I hate art), but I'll never forget this one.
